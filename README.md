# Kaggle_SETI_Signal_Search

This is a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/seti-breakthrough-listen/overview

Description:

In this competition, use your data science skills to help identify anomalous signals in scans of Breakthrough Listen targets.
Because there are no confirmed examples of alien signals to use to train machine learning algorithms, the team included some simulated signals (that they call “needles”) in the haystack of data from the telescope.
They have identified some of the hidden needles so that you can train your model to find more.
The data consist of two-dimensional arrays, so there may be approaches from computer vision that are promising, as well as digital signal processing, anomaly detection, and more.
